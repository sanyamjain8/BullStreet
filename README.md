 How cool is Pump.fun, right.

But its cool only on Solana, Why not on Ethereum.?

This was the question first asked and we did research. The conclusion: Its possible on Ethereum too.

How?

With Bullstreet.fun

But what makes it unique?

This will not be another project focusing only on memecoin, there are more than just memecoin on ethereum, and we will utilise it to fullest.

One liner intro of the project:

A launchpad targeted towards communities according to use cases not just with memecoins, but assets, content and many more. Our vision: interchain asset transfer available on launchpad for combining distributed community of ethereum at one place. How are we building it?

What to Expect:

Diverse Asset Support:
Unlike traditional launchpads, Bullstreet.fun will support a wide array of assets beyond memecoins, including unique content and other blockchain-based resources.

Our vision
Bullstreet.fun aims to be the go-to platform for community-driven projects on Ethereum. By combining powerful tools for asset management, integration with the NeoX chain, and in-depth analytics with the help of Chainsight, we strive to create a comprehensive and user-centric launchpad experience.
